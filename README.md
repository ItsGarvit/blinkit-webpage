This is my repository for making the *frontend* webpage of blinkit

BlinkIt Clone - Front-End Project
This project is a front-end clone of the BlinkIt (formerly Grofers) homepage. It is created using fundamental web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive features. The main goal of this project is to replicate the visual layout and a key interactive feature of a modern e-commerce website.

Features
Responsive Header: A sticky header that contains the logo, a delivery address input, a search bar, login link, and a "My Cart" button.

Dynamic Search/Filter: A real-time search bar that filters the "Shop by Category" section. As you type, categories that don't match your search will be hidden.

Category Display: A clean, grid-based layout for product categories with hover effects.

Promotional Sections: Includes hero banner sections to display featured products or offers.

Structured Footer: A multi-column footer with useful links, category shortcuts, and social media links.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web page.

CSS3: For all styling, including layout with Flexbox, fonts, colors, and hover effects.

Vanilla JavaScript: To implement the client-side search and filter functionality.

Setup and Usage
This is a static front-end project and does not require any special build steps or dependencies.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd your-repository-name
Open the index.html file:
Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to view the project.

Note on Images: In your index.html file, one of the images is linked as ./unnamed.png. Please make sure your image file is named unnamed.png or update the <img> tag in the HTML to match the correct filename (e.g., unnamed.jpg).

Code Overview
index.html: This file contains the entire structure of the webpage, from the header to the footer. All content is organized using semantic HTML tags.

style.css: This file handles the presentation and styling. It uses Flexbox for layout and includes styles for all components, responsiveness helpers, and interactive elements like hover effects.

script.js: This file provides the interactive search functionality. It listens for input in the search bar and dynamically updates the visibility of the category cards based on the user's input.

Future Improvements
Full Responsiveness: Add CSS media queries to ensure the layout is optimized for mobile phones and tablets.

Component-Based Structure: Refactor the code using a framework like React to create reusable components for elements like the header, footer, and category cards.

Add More Pages: Create separate pages for user login, product details, and the shopping cart.

Backend Integration: Connect the front-end to a backend service to fetch real product data and handle user authentication.
